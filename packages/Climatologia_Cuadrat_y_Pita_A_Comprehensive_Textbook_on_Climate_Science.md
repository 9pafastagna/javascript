# Climatologia Cuadrat y Pita: A Comprehensive Textbook on Climate Science
 
Climatologia Cuadrat y Pita is a textbook written by Jose M. Cuadrat and Maria F. Pita, two professors of geography at the University of Zaragoza, Spain. The book covers the main aspects of climatology, the science that studies the climate and its variations. It is intended for students and professionals who want to learn more about the physical processes, spatial patterns, temporal changes, and human impacts of the climate system.

The book consists of 12 chapters, each one divided into several sections and subsections. The chapters are:
 
- Introduction to climatology: The concept and definition of climate, the history and development of climatology, the methods and sources of climatic data, and the classification and regionalization of climates.
- The solar radiation and the energy balance: The origin and characteristics of solar radiation, the interaction of solar radiation with the atmosphere and the Earth's surface, the global energy balance, and the factors that influence the spatial and temporal distribution of energy.
- The atmospheric temperature: The definition and measurement of temperature, the vertical structure and distribution of temperature in the atmosphere, the factors that affect the horizontal and temporal variations of temperature, and the extreme temperatures and their effects.
- The atmospheric pressure and the winds: The definition and measurement of pressure, the vertical structure and distribution of pressure in the atmosphere, the general circulation of the atmosphere, the local and regional winds, and the wind systems associated with cyclones and anticyclones.
- The atmospheric humidity and precipitation: The definition and measurement of humidity, the processes of evaporation, condensation, and precipitation, the types and forms of precipitation, the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation, and the factors that influence precipitation variability.
- The atmospheric circulation and climate variability: The concept and causes of atmospheric circulation, the main modes of climate variability at different time scales (such as El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, etc.), and their impacts on regional and global climates.
- The climate change: The concept and definition of climate change, the natural and anthropogenic factors that cause climate change, the evidence and indicators of climate change, the methods and models for climate change detection and projection, and the consequences and responses to climate change.
- The bioclimatology: The concept and objectives of bioclimatology, the bioclimatic factors and indices, the bioclimatic regions and zones, and the applications of bioclimatology to human health, agriculture, forestry, tourism, etc.
- The urban climatology: The concept and characteristics of urban climatology, the urban heat island effect, the urban air pollution, the urban wind field, the urban precipitation modification, and
the urban planning strategies for climate adaptation.
- The applied climatology: The concept and scope of applied climatology, the climatic data analysis techniques (such as descriptive statistics, trend analysis, frequency analysis,
correlation analysis,
etc.), 
the climatic data interpolation methods (such as Thiessen polygons,
kriging,
splines,
etc.), 
and
the climatic data presentation methods (such as maps,
graphs,
tables,
etc.).
- The synoptic climatology: The concept
and
methods
of
synoptic climatology,
the classification
and
identification
of
synoptic types,
the synoptic-climatic regions
and
subregions,
and
the synoptic-climatic analysis
of
selected cases
of
extreme events (such as heat waves,
cold waves,
droughts,
floods,
storms,
etc.).
- The regional climatology: The concept
and
criteria
of
regional climatology,
the regional climatic characteristics
of
the main continents
and
oceans,
and
the regional climatic studies
of
selected areas (such as Europe,
Mediterranean Basin,
North America,
South America,
Africa,
Asia,
Australia,
Antarctica,
etc.).
